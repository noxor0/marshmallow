A clone of the old flash game, Storm The House. 
Entire code written by me. This project is for practice and keeping Java skills fresh
Bonus: Learned how to use git.

Game Info:
Protect the world from angry squares. Click on them to shoot.
Buy items between waves and see how long you can last. (I think the max is 100 ish)

If anyone does see this, feel free to message or email me if you have any questions.
