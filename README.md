A clone of the old flash game, Storm The House. 
Entire code written by me. Started this project to practice and keep Java skills fresh.
Bonus: Learned how to use git.

Game Info:
Protect the world from angry squares. Click on them to shoot.
Buy items between waves and see how long you can last. (I think the max is 100 ish)
Might add more things. My ADD will get the better of me and I'll probably start a new project.

If anyone does see this, feel free to message or email me if you have any questions.
